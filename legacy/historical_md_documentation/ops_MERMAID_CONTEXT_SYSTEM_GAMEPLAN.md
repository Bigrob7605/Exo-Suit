# MERMAID CONTEXT SYSTEM GAMEPLAN
## ANTI-HAND WAVE AGENT VISIBILITY SYSTEM

**Goal**: Create a 100% context file that gives ANY agent 1M+ token visibility into the entire Exo-Suit system, eliminating guesswork and enabling precise code analysis.

## TARGET **CORE PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**
- **Current State**: Agents are flying blind, can't see the full codebase context
- **Missing**: Mermaid dependency mapping, file relationship visualization, system architecture overview
- **Result**: Ineffective scanning, missed connections, hand-wavy analysis

2. **Code Structure Analyzer**
   - Parse Python, PowerShell, JavaScript files
   - Extract function definitions, class hierarchies
   - Map import/export relationships
   - Identify core vs. utility vs. test files

3. **Mermaid Diagram Generator**
   - System architecture overview
   - File dependency trees
   - Component interaction flows
   - Data flow diagrams

### **Phase 2: Context Consolidation (Week 2)**
1. **Context File Builder**
   - Generate single 1M+ token context file
   - Include all critical code snippets
   - Add comprehensive file listings with metadata
   - Embed Mermaid diagrams for visual understanding

2. **Smart Context Chunking**
   - Implement intelligent file grouping
   - Create context sections by functionality
   - Enable targeted context loading
   - Support both full and partial context views

3. **Context Validation System**
   - Verify context completeness
   - Test with various agent types
   - Measure context effectiveness
   - Iterate based on agent feedback

### **Phase 3: Agent Integration (Week 3)**
1. **Context Loading Interface**
   - Simple context loading commands
   - Context search and filtering
   - Context update mechanisms
   - Context version control

2. **Agent Training & Testing**
   - Test context with different agent types
   - Measure context comprehension
   - Optimize context presentation
   - Create context usage guidelines
