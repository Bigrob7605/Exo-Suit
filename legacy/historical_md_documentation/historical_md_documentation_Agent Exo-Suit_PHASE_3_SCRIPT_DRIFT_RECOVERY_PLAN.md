# PHASE 3 SCRIPT DRIFT RECOVERY PLAN
## Consolidating 43+ Tools into Core V5 System

**Status**: CRITICAL - Script drift detected, consolidation required  
**Target**: Single unified V5 system with all 43+ capabilities integrated  
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks maximum  

---

## üö® THE PROBLEM: SCRIPT DRIFT

### **What's Happening**
- **36+ scattered scripts** instead of unified system
- **Agents keep creating scanning scripts** instead of consolidating tools
- **Legacy V1-V4 files** still being used instead of V5 core
- **Amazing tools scattered** across toolbox folder, not integrated
- **Performance claims** but no unified execution

### **Root Cause**
- Agents focus on **creating new scripts** instead of **consolidating existing tools**
- **No clear V5 core system** to build upon
- **Toolbox gems** not integrated into main system
- **Legacy file dependencies** preventing V5 adoption
