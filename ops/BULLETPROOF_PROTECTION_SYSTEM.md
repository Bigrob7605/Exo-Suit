        "V5_", "V4_", "KAI_", "INTEGRATION_", "PROTECTION_",
        "TECHNICAL_SPECS", "BLUEPRINT", "ROADMAP", "MANIFEST"
    ]
    
    for pattern in protected_patterns:
        if pattern in file_path.upper():
            return True
    
    return False

def log_file_operation(operation: str, file_path: str, reason: str):
    """Log all file operations for audit trail"""
    timestamp = datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
    log_entry = {
        "timestamp": timestamp,
        "operation": operation,
        "file_path": file_path,
        "reason": reason,
        "agent": "AGENT_ID"
