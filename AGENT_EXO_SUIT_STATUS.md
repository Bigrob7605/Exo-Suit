## 🚀 Next Steps for Drifted Project Testing

### **Phase 1: Initial Assessment** (Immediate)

1. **Run Full Exo-Suit Scan**
   ```powershell
   cd "Universal Open Science Toolbox With Kai"
   ..\refresh.ps1
   ```

2. **Analyze Results**
   - Review `context/_latest/placeholders.json` for BLOCK items
   - Check `context/_latest/ownership.json` for ownership conflicts
   - Examine `context/_latest/lock_age.json` for outdated dependencies

3. **Generate Drift Report**
   ```powershell
   .\ops\drift-gate.ps1 -json
   ```

### **Phase 2: Drift Resolution** (High Priority)

1. **Address BLOCK Items**
   - Prioritize BLOCK severity items
   - Create resolution plan for each
   - Track progress in `PLAN.md`

2. **Ownership Reconciliation**
   - Review ownership conflicts
   - Route diffs to appropriate owners
   - Update ownership mappings if needed

3. **Dependency Updates**
   - Identify outdated lock files
   - Plan dependency updates
   - Test compatibility

### **Phase 3: System Restoration** (Critical)

1. **V1 Core System Integration**
   - Integrate Kai core system from recovery folder
   - Restore memory persistence system
   - Test agent functionality

2. **Enhanced Features Integration**
   - Merge enhanced API reference
   - Integrate enhanced scientific domains
   - Restore advanced features

3. **Validation and Testing**
   - Run comprehensive validation suite
   - Test all endpoints and functionality
   - Verify system integrity
