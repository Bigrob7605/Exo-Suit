## MISSION OVERVIEW: PROJECT REVIVAL AND HEALING

### **Core Mission**
The Agent Exo-Suit V5.0 is not just a token processor - it's a **PROJECT HEALING SYSTEM** designed to:
- **Revive damaged projects** destroyed by lesser agents
- **Rebuild from the ground up** using core MD files
- **Process real data** to understand project health and damage
- **Create comprehensive healing reports** that can guide full project restoration
- **Build the foundation** for projects to become everything their vision claims

### **Why This Matters**
- **Projects are being damaged** by agents that don't understand the full vision
- **Core MD files are being lost** or corrupted during "fixes"
- **Real data processing** is needed to understand what's actually broken
- **Project healing** requires understanding the full scope of damage
- **Ground-up rebuilding** is the only way to restore true project integrity
