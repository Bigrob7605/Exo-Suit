## 🎯 Testing Objective

**Primary Question**: Does MMH-RS compression technology improve UCML compression performance, or does it introduce overhead that hurts performance?

**Secondary Questions**:
- Which compression algorithms work best with UCML data?
- What's the performance trade-off between speed and compression ratio?
- Can we create a hybrid approach that combines both systems?
