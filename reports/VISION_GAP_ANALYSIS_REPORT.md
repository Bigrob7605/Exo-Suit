### Medium Priority Actions
- Address INSUFFICIENT_TESTING: Testing coverage is 0% (target: 80%+)
- Address INSUFFICIENT_DOCUMENTATION: Documentation coverage is 0% (target: 60%+)

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Address Critical Gaps**: Focus on CRITICAL priority gaps first
2. **Implement Missing Features**: Build missing functionality identified in vision
3. **Improve Coverage**: Enhance testing and documentation coverage
4. **Validate Alignment**: Re-run analysis after implementing fixes
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Regularly check vision-implementation alignment

## CONCLUSION

The VisionGap Engine has identified 436 gaps between your project vision and current implementation. 

**Alignment Score**: 5/100

By addressing these gaps systematically, you can achieve perfect alignment between your dreams and reality.

**Ready to bridge the gap between vision and implementation!**
