.SYNOPSIS
    PHASE 4 ULTIMATE SYSTEM LAUNCHER - Complete 1M Token Powerhouse
    
.DESCRIPTION
    This launcher will execute all three Phase 4 systems in sequence:
    - Phase 4A: Memory Distribution Engine (spreads processing across all memory)
    - Phase 4B: Repository Devourer (eats entire repositories)
    - Phase 4C: Intelligent Fix Engine (automatically fixes everything)
    
    The result will be a FLAWLESS 1M TOKEN SYSTEM that can handle 10M+ tokens
    and utilize 80GB+ of your system's memory across all tiers.
    
.NOTES
    Author: Agent Exo-Suit V5.0
    Version: 1.0
    Date: 2025-08-13
    Target: 80GB+ memory utilization, 10M+ token capacity
