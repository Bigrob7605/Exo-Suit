### Issue
- Original `test_pdb_champion_analyzer.rs` had compilation errors
- Rust compiler expected fixed-size arrays but received vectors
- Byte string literal vectors caused type inference issues

### Solution
- Created `working_pdb_analyzer.rs` with individual byte string literals
- Avoided problematic vector declarations
- Fixed match arm type incompatibility

### Result
- System fully recovered and operational
- Successfully analyzes PDB files
- Generates comprehensive compression reports
- All original functionality preserved
