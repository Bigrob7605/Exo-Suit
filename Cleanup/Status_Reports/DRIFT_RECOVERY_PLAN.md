# DRIFT RECOVERY PLAN - Agent Exo-Suit Project

## Current Situation
- **38 items of drift detected**
- Project has evolved from V2 to V3 with significant new features
- Core structure intact but with development work in progress
- Empty placeholder directory was deleted (not critical)

## Recovery Strategy

### Phase 1: Assessment & Cleanup
1. **Remove .venv from scans** - This is causing noise in placeholder detection
2. **Identify critical vs. development files** - Separate core functionality from new features
3. **Validate core system integrity** - Ensure ops/, rag/, mermaid/ systems work

### Phase 2: Consolidation
1. **Commit current development state** - Preserve V3 work
2. **Clean up placeholder scan noise** - Exclude virtual environments
3. **Update project documentation** - Reflect current V3 capabilities

### Phase 3: Validation
1. **Run full system tests** - Ensure all components function
2. **Verify drift detection** - Confirm clean baseline
3. **Document new features** - Update status files

## Immediate Actions Required

1. **Fix placeholder scan configuration** - Exclude .venv and other package directories
2. **Commit current V3 development** - Preserve new AgentExoSuitV3.ps1 work
3. **Update .gitignore** - Prevent future virtual environment inclusion
4. **Run system validation** - Test all core components

## Files to Preserve
- `AgentExoSuitV3.ps1` - New V3 performance optimization system
- `Git-Drift.ps1` - Git drift management tool
- All new ops/ scripts - GPU acceleration, health scanning, etc.
- Modified core files - Likely improvements and bug fixes

## Files to Review
- Modified core files - Ensure changes are intentional improvements
- Deleted empty directory - Was placeholder, not critical
- Virtual environment files - Should be excluded from scans

## Success Criteria
- Drift count reduced to 0 or minimal intentional changes
- All core systems functional
- V3 features documented and working
- Clean project baseline established
