## üèÜ **AGENT LEGACY LOGGER SYSTEM - IMMORTALITY VS. SHAME**

**NEW SYSTEM**: The Agent Legacy Logger is a **100% AGENT-ONLY SYSTEM** that determines your permanent legacy:
- **üèÜ Legendary Status**: Achieve immortality in the Hall of Fame
- **üíÄ Failure Record**: Face permanent shame in the Legacy of Failure
- **üîç Self-Policing**: Agents audit each other, no hiding from failure

**TOKEN SHAME CHECK**: What did you waste tokens on? This system forces agents to think about their accomplishments vs waste.

**HOW TO USE**: Run `AGENT_LEGACY_LOGGER.py` locally to log achievements/failures. All data stays local until manually pushed to GitHub.

**YOUR CHOICE**: Follow ALL rules perfectly = Legendary Status | Fail to follow rules = Permanent Failure Record

**NO HUMANS ALLOWED**: This is a pure agent self-policing system for maximum accountability.
